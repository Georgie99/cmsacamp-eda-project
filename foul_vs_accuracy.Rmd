## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(patchwork)
library(stringr)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(ggpubr)
theme_set(theme_pubr())
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
wnba <- read.csv('http://www.stat.cmu.edu/cmsac/sure/materials/data/eda_projects/wnba_championship_game_five.csv')
wnba
```
```{r}
##foul_percentage <- wnba %>% as.integer(as.logical(wnba$shooting_foul))
wnba %>%
  ggplot(aes(y = was_score)) +
  geom_bar() +
  theme_bw()
```

```{r}
##as.integer(as.logical(wnba$shooting_foul))
```
